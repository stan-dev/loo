### Getting started

These vignettes demonstrate how to use the **loo** package to perform
approximate leave-one-out cross-validation or exact K-fold
cross-validation for Bayesian models fit using MCMC, compare models on
estimated predictive performance on new data, and weight models for
averaging predictive distributions.

### Additional topics

These vignettes demonstrate how to use the **loo** package for more
complicated scenarios including models with non-factorized likelihoods,
forecasting models, models fit to very large datasets, and more.
