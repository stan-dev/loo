\title{Extract pointwise log-likelihood from a Stan model}
\usage{
extract_log_lik(stanfit, parameter_name = "log_lik", merge_chains = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{stanfit}{A \code{stanfit} object (\pkg{rstan} package).}

\item{parameter_name}{A character string naming the parameter (or generated
quantity) in the Stan model corresponding to the log-likelihood.}

\item{merge_chains}{If \code{TRUE} (the default), all Markov chains are
merged together (i.e., stacked) and a matrix is returned. If \code{FALSE}
they are kept separate and an array is returned.}
}
\value{
If \code{merge_chains=TRUE}, an \eqn{S} by \eqn{N} matrix of
(post-warmup) extracted draws, where \eqn{S} is the size of the posterior
sample and \eqn{N} is the number of data points. If
\code{merge_chains=FALSE}, an \eqn{I} by \eqn{C} by \eqn{N} array, where
\eqn{I \times C = S}{I * C = S}.

\description{
Convenience function for extracting the pointwise log-likelihood
matrix or array from a fitted Stan model.
}
\details{
Stan does not automatically compute and store the log-likelihood. It
is up to the user to incorporate it into the Stan program if it is to be
extracted after fitting the model. In a Stan model, the pointwise log
likelihood can be coded as a vector in the transformed parameters block
(and then summed up in the model block) or it can be coded entirely in the
generated quantities block. We recommend using the generated quantities
block so that the computations are carried out only once per iteration
rather than once per HMC leapfrog step.

For example, the following is the \verb{generated quantities} block for
computing and saving the log-likelihood for a linear regression model with
\code{N} data points, outcome \code{y}, predictor matrix \code{X},
coefficients \code{beta}, and standard deviation \code{sigma}:

\verb{vector[N] log_lik;}

\code{for (n in 1:N) log_lik[n] = normal_lpdf(y[n] | X[n, ] * beta, sigma);}
