\title{Datasets for loo examples and vignettes}
\description{
Small datasets for use in \strong{loo} examples and vignettes. The \code{Kline}
and \code{milk} datasets are also included in the \strong{rethinking} package
(McElreath, 2016a), but we include them here as \strong{rethinking} is not
on CRAN.
}
\details{
Currently the data sets included are:
\itemize{
\item \code{Kline}:
Small dataset from Kline and Boyd (2010) on tool complexity and demography
in Oceanic islands societies. This data is discussed in detail in
McElreath (2016a,2016b). \href{https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/rethinking/versions/1.59/topics/Kline}{(Link to variable descriptions)}
\item \code{milk}:
Small dataset from Hinde and Milligan (2011) on primate milk
composition.This data is discussed in detail in McElreath (2016a,2016b).
