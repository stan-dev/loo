      These vignettes demonstrate how to use the **loo**
      package to perform approximate leave-one-out cross-validation or
      exact K-fold cross-validation for Bayesian models fit using MCMC,
      compare models on estimated predictive performance on new data, and
      weight models for averaging predictive distributions.

    desc: >
      These vignettes demonstrate how to use the **loo** package for more
      complicated scenarios including models with non-factorized likelihoods,
      forecasting models, models fit to very large datasets, and more.
