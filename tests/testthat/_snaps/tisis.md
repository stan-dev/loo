# tis throws correct errors and warnings

    Code
      psis(-LLarr, r_eff = r_eff_arr)
    Message
      If `r_eff` has length `len` but has `NA`s then `NA`s are replaced with 1's.
    Output
      Computed from 1000 by 32 log-weights matrix.
      MCSE and ESS estimates assume MCMC draws (r_eff in [0.6, 1.0]).
      
      All Pareto k estimates are good (k < 0.67).
